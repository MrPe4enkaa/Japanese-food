This is my first frontend project, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a product catalog with an interactive shopping cart.  

### Technologies Used  
- HTML – Structure and content  
- CSS – Styling and layout  
- JavaScript – Functionality and interactivity  
- GSAP – Animations  
- jQuery – DOM manipulation  
- Local Storage – Saving cart data  

## Features  
- Displaying a product catalog
